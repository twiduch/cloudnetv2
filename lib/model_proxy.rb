# Just some syntactic sugar to run model methods on a worker process.
# By including this module you can run any method on a worker using Sidekiq's `perform_async()`
# by simply prepending a method call with `.worker`, eg; `worker.long_running_thing()`.
# We take advantage of the fact that it is easy to instantiate a basic model instance with eg;
# `instance = ModelName.find instance.id`. This means that the instance can be easily serialised
# and sent to the worker process.
